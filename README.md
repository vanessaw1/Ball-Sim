# Ball-Sim

Collision implemented with the help of the following tutorial: [When Worlds Collide: Simulating Circle-Circle Collisions]
(http://gamedevelopment.tutsplus.com/tutorials/when-worlds-collide-simulating-circle-circle-collisions--gamedev-769)

##### Known Bugs
- Balls can get stuck in the floor
- Balls can get stuck together if going too fast or if created on top of each other
- Balls flicker at high speeds

##### Potential Features to Implement
- Ability to fling balls upon creation instead of giving a set initial velocity (as shown in [this tutorial]
(http://www.petercollingridge.co.uk/pygame-physics-simulation/mouse-interactions))
- Ability to track a ball's path (as shown in [these gifs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brownian_motion))
- More accurate collision implementation (currently balls can bounce on top of each other without deflecting)
